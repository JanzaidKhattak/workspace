Create a Typing Center Management System using HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQLite, designed to handle multiple branches, employees, and services with a clean and user-friendly interface. The system will have a hybrid login model, where an admin can manage all branches and employees, set receipt branding including logo, company name, header, footer, and address, and control service lists and commission rates. Branches will have their own logins, and each branch can have multiple employee sub-accounts. Employees can create receipts for customers, with auto-generated receipt numbers, date and time, and their own names included, while PDFs of the receipts will automatically include admin-set branding and can be shared via WhatsApp or downloaded for printing. All receipts will be stored in the database and linked to the branch and employee for easy tracking and reporting.

The system will include a robust activity log, tracking every action performed by employees, such as receipt creation and service details, which will be visible to the branch manager for branch-level oversight and to the admin for full system transparency. Admins can generate branch-wise and employee-wise reports, view monthly income summaries, and export reports in PDF or CSV formats. A salary module will allow admins to set each employeeâ€™s basic salary and per-service commission, calculate monthly salaries automatically based on the services performed, and generate salary slips that can also be shared via WhatsApp. This ensures accountability, transparency, and easy management across multiple branches and employees.

The database structure will include tables for admin, branches, employees, services, receipts, salaries, and activity logs, all interconnected to provide seamless tracking and reporting. The UI will be responsive and intuitive, using Bootstrap or custom CSS for tables, forms, dashboards, and activity feeds, with sortable and searchable tables for receipts and employee records. Additional features like light/dark mode, multi-language support (English + Arabic), and quick addition of new branches or employees will enhance usability and scalability, making it a professional and ready-to-use system.

The development flow will start with setting up the SQLite database and authentication system, followed by building dashboards for admin, branch, and employees, then implementing receipt creation with PDF generation and WhatsApp sharing, the salary module, and reporting functionality. Finally, UI enhancements and responsive design will be applied, all hosted on a free platform like Replit, making it a fully functional, professional, and easy-to-use typing center management solution.
